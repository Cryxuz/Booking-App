# Nestify

### Nestify is a booking app built using the MERN stack. I incorporated JWT tokens for authentication, bcrypt for secure password hashing, and cookie-parser for parsing cookies. My primary focus with this project is to gain practice in passing props both from parent to child and vice versa.
